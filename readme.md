# NASA Space Apps Challenge Project

This repository contains my project for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**, focusing on building a platform that allows users to explore massive image datasets (Earth observations, lunar maps, or deep space images) without losing clarity while zooming.

The web application demonstrates the use of **SVG images** to maintain sharpness at any zoom level. It is built with **HTML** and **JavaScript** and designed to be user-friendly for researchers, students, and space enthusiasts alike.
